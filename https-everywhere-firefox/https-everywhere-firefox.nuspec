Encrypt the web! HTTPS Everywhere is a Firefox extension to protect your communications by enabling HTTPS encryption automatically on sites that are known to support it, even when you type URLs or follow links that omit the https: prefix.Many sites on the web offer some limited support for encryption over HTTPS, but make it difficult to use. For instance, they may default to unencrypted HTTP, or fill encrypted pages with links that go back to the unencrypted site.

The HTTPS Everywhere extension fixes these problems by rewriting all requests to these sites to HTTPS.

PACKAGING NOTE: This addon will be installed for all profiles. You can not remove the addon through Firefox - only manually by removing the folder from \extensions or by uninstalling the package. You will have to confirm in Firefox if you want to enable the addon (thats a security feature of Firefox). You can Disable it within Firefox. The package should always install the latest version, independent of the package version. Subsequent updates should be dealt with automatically by Firefox.
