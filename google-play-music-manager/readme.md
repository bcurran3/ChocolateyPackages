**BCURRAN3'S PACKAGE NOTES:**

* DISCLAIMER: This package uses an AutoHotKey script to attempt automatic installation of the program. I have done my best to make this work for the majority, there are always a number of x-factors that can cause a 'hiccup.' Some events are timed and may timeout and thus fail on slower than expected systems. It is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED that you monitor the installation of this package to make sure it worked/installed correctly in your environment. There are situations such as upgrades and forced reinstalls that may not work and you will have to manually enter input to get the desired result. If you report an issue in GitHub and the program is in active development, I will try to enhance the AHK script and this package in the future.
* This program is updated semi-frequently. The download URL in this package will always download the latest version. Versions of the program released after this package will fail checksums. If you get an error installing this package please try --ignore-checksums and open a GitHub Issue requesting the package to be updated.
* An extra note about Google programs: Google updates the installer frequently even without changing the program version. When this happens the install will fail based on checksums. I recommend installing with --ignore-checksums if you have a problem. I really don't want to re-release this program 3 or 4 times because the installer changed but the program didn't. PLEASE check the program version after install and I would happy to release a new package when the actual program gets upgraded and not just the installer. If you find a newer version open a GitHub Issue requesting the package to be upgraded.
* At some point in the future this package will be setup for creation by Auto Update (when I figure it out) which will solve the above problem.
* I personally use and endorse this program.
