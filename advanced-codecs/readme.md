**BCURRAN3'S PACKAGE NOTES:**

* Binary is included in the package. This is a forever package.
* Shark007's 64bit ADVANCED Codecs is updated by the author on average of twice a week. I tend to update this package 2-4 times a month. 
* I personally use and endorse this program.
* As of package v17.0.0 this package installs the portable version of 64bit ADVANCED Codecs as installer releases have been discontinued. Files are installed to C:\Program Files\Shark007.
