Centipede (c) PJ Crossley MMDCCLXIV

The Centipedes - consist of one or more attached segments which move horizontally through the playfield, moving one tile vertically when they hit the side of the screen, or a mushroom. Shoot a segment, and it will turn into a mushroom. If a centipede is split in half in this fashion, the segment behind the shot will form a head and you'll have two smaller centipedes to contend with. 
Mushrooms - harmless to the touch, but take four shots to destroy. The player and centipedes can't move through them. 
Poison mushrooms - These don't kill anything. But, when a centipede hits a poison mushroom, they go straight down until they hit the bottom of the screen. 
Spiders - they come in from the side and scurry around the bottom half of the screen really fast, making wibbledy-wibbledy sounds. 
Scorpions - they crawl through the top half of the screen and change mushrooms into poison mushrooms. 
Fleas - they occasionally drop through the screen, leaving a trail of mushrooms.
