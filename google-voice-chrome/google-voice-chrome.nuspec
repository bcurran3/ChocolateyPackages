###Make calls, send SMS, preview Inbox, and get notified of new messages. (US only)
New:
* Bug fixes.

Extension Features:
* Adds a button to the toolbar, which displays the number of unread messages in your Google Voice inbox.
* Audible alert on new messages (can turn off in extension options).
* Gives you quick access to your most recent messages with transcripts and voicemail playback.
* Lets you initiate calls and send free text messages by just typing any number or contact name.
* Makes phone numbers on websites callable via Google Voice by just clicking on them.
* If a phone number doesn't turn into a link on any website (ex: Google Calendar), you can select the text with your mouse and the click to call popup will automatically display (note: might not work with all numbers).

Info:
* If you don't like the extension turning numbers into click to call links then you can turn it off in the extension options.
* SMS is only available for accounts with a Google Number. SMS is not available in voicemail only accounts.

Known issues:
* Incompatible with the Skype extension. If the Skype extension is installed then the Voice extension will not turn numbers into call links.
* Sometimes your forwarding phone list will be empty. If this happens make sure you are logged in to http://www.google.com/voice and then wait ~30 minutes. The problem should fix itselft automatically within 30 minutes and work from then on.
