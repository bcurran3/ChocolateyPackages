###WHAT'S THIS ALL ABOUT?

The average person probably doesn't need this. This package is primarily for sysadmins who have to constantly configure computers and make sure they are all the same. Sure, there are other methods of doing these same functions. You can manually change the settings, it doesn't take that long. You could use GPO or a configuration manager, but not everyone has access to these tools - but you have access to Chocolatey! I put Chocolatey on just about every box I touch... so I made this Chocolatey package for (almost) super simple configuration, well, really so I can add it to my setup scripts. Installing this package is probably too complex for the average person, but it should be of good use to those who script or automate a lot of installs using Chocolatey. This is part of a series of "-winconfig" packages for configuration automation. Others include [desktopicons-winconfig](https://chocolatey.org/packages/desktopicons-winconfig), [homepages-winconfig](https://chocolatey.org/packages/homepages-winconfig), and [taskbar-winconfig](https://chocolatey.org/packages/taskbar-winconfig)

###INSTALL INSTRUCTIONS:
You NEED to install **explorer-winconfig** with package parameters or it will do nothing. Below is the list of settings you can change with the parameters:

* Explorer SHOWEXTENSIONS - /SHOWEXTENSIONS:yes or /SHOWEXTENSIONS:no
* Explorer SHOWFULLPATH - /SHOWFULLPATH:yes or /SHOWFULLPATH:no
* Explorer SHOWHIDDEN - /SHOWHIDDEN:yes or /SHOWHIDDEN:no or /SHOWHIDDEN:all (files and system files)

* Explorer USESHARINGWIZARD - /USESHARINGWIZARD:yes or /USESHARINGWIZARD:no

You're desktop will blink off and return as explorer is restarted at the end of the script so the changes are immediately available.

###INSTALL EXAMPLES:
* choco install explorer-winconfig --params "'/SHOWEXTENSIONS:yes /SHOWFULLPATH:yes /SHOWENCRYPTED:yes /SHOWCHECKBOXES:no /USESHARINGWIZARD:no /USEVIEW:details'"
* choco install explorer-winconfig --params "'/SHOWEXTENSIONS:yes /SHOWCHECKBOXES:yes /SHOWPREVIEWPANE:yes'"

You can set any one option or any mix of options. If you don't specify any parameters, nothing will change. Default = do nothing.

**There is no upgrade path for this package. explorer-winconfig is a "one and done" package. It is recommended you uninstall this package after install (settings will NOT revert) so that you can install it again under a different user account if necessary. Settings changes only effect the currently logged in user. Of course, you could reinstall it again with -force to change the options.**
