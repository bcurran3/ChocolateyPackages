**BCURRAN3'S PACKAGE NOTES:**

* This package downloads the installer via a version specific URL. It should never fail unless the version is completely removed from the vendor website.
* "REBOOT=R" argument implemented as of this package version to supress reboots.
* I personally use and endorse this program.
