<h3>BCURRAN3'S PACKAGE NOTES:</h3>

* This package includes the distribution binary and thus is a "forever package."
* To automated this package, it is installed with the install --root option thus skipping creating a new user. When you run WSL you will be logged in as root. To create a user use the adduser command.
* If you encounter errors such as Error: 0x80070005 Press any key to continue... it usually means that WSL has lost track of the distro files (they might have moved or been deleted.) You should uninstall the package. If the package is missing you can list your installed distros with wslconfig /list, remove the distro with wslconfig /unregister distroname, then simply reinstall the package.
