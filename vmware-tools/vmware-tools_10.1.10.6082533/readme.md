**BCURRAN3'S PACKAGE NOTES:**

* This package downloads the installer via a version specific URL. It should never fail unless the version is completely removed from the vendor website.
* If VMware Tools is not already installed, installation of this package is going to cause a reboot of your VM whether you like it or not!
* VMware Tools upgrades will not cause a reboot.
* I personally use and endorse this program.
