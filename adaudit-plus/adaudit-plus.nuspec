##REAL-TIME WINDOWS ACTIVE DIRECTORY AUDITING

In real-time, ensure critical resources in the network like the Domain Controllers are audited, monitored and reported with the entire information on AD objects - Users, Groups, GPO, Computer, OU, DNS, AD Schema and Configuration changes with 200+ detailed event specific GUI reports and email alerts.	

###Insider Threats
Unearth the telltale signs of an insider attack. For a given account, extract a consolidation of 3 audit trails -- user actions in AD, access reports, and permission change reports. The audit trail offers a context which makes spotting the insider easier. Also, you get to instantly learn which computers a user compromised and the changes.
 
###User Logon
Monitor user logon activity in real-time on Domain Controllers with pre-configured audit reports and email alerts. Audit reports ensure the administrator knows the reason behind users’ logon failures, login history, terminal services activity, and users’ recent logon activities across the Windows server network.

In real-time, track Windows AD object changes (Users, OU, Groups, GPO, Computer, Schema, DNS and System) and get email alerts on unauthorized network access / modification events.
