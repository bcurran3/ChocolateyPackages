# **choco-package-list-backup** solves your Chocolatey migration and package re-installation problems!

## **choco-package-list-backup (CPLB)** is a script I wrote that will backup the list of your currently installed Chocolatey packages and save them to a PACKAGES.CONFIG file. You can then use that PACKAGES.CONFIG file to re-install all your packages on another computer or even the same computer later if it crashes. "How can I re-install on the same computer if it crashed and I lost the PACKAGES.CONFIG file?" Thanks for asking! **CPLB** backs up your package list locally AND to multiple cloud services! But wait, there's more! **CPBL** also saves your pinned package info. But wait, there's even more! **CPBL** also saves a list of ALL your programs even if they weren't installed by Chocolatey. Pretty darn cool huh?

### FEATURES:
* **CPLB** supports saving PACKAGES.CONFIG to all of the following:
     01. your local Documents folder
     02. your Active Directory assigned HOMESHARE
     03. Box
     04. Dropbox Personal and Business
     05. Google Drive and Drive File Stream
     06. iCloudDrive
     07. Microsoft OneDrive (free, paid consumer, and corporate)
     08. NETGEAR ReadyCLOUD
     09. Nextcloud
     10. ownCloud
     11. Resilio Sync
     12. Seafile
     13. TonidoSync
     14. A custom location of your choice
     15. C:\Users\Public\Documents when run from system account
* **CPLB** runs on install to make sure you have backup(s) right now!
* **CPLB** backups every Monday at 6 AM in the background to C:\Users\Public\Documents. Set it and forget it! 
* **CPLB** supports copying [InstChoco - The ULTIMATE Chocolatey and Chocolatey packages (re)installer!](https://chocolatey.org/packages/instchoco) to your PACKAGES.CONFIG backup location(s) for the fastest way ever to reinstall Chocolatey and your Chocolatey packages! (Or migrate!)
* **CPLB** supports backing up PERSISTENTPACKAGES.CONFIG if you are using [Choco Persistent Packages](https://chocolatey.org/packages/choco-persistent-packages).
* **CPLB** integrates with [Chocolatey Shortcuts](https://chocolatey.org/packages/choco-shortcuts-winconfig).
* **CPLB** saves in computer (name) specific folders so you can backup your Chocolatey package list from multiple computers to the same cloud destination(s). No confusion over what computer gets what packages!
* **CPLB** saves a list of all your installed programs (AllProgramsList.txt) whether they were installed by Chocolatey or not.
* **CPLB** saves your pinned information to pins.bat for easy re-pinning packages.
* **CPLB** is in your path and ready to run.
* **CPLB** is configurable. You can: (continued in Release Notes)

### OPTIONAL INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
* **choco install choco-package-list-backup --params "'/ONSTART:TRUE'"** - scheduled task to run at boot instead of at a scheduled time
* **choco install choco-package-list-backup --params "'/NOTASK:TRUE'"** - won't configure a scheduled task
* **choco install choco-package-list-backup --params "'/NORUN:TRUE'"** - won't run the script upon install (let's you configure before first run)

### INSTRUCTIONS:

* From PowerShell or the Command Prompt, type CPLB or CHOCO-PACKAGE-LIST-BACKUP to backup your Chocolatey packages list.
