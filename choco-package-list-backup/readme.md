#**choco-package-list-backup** solves your Chocolatey migration and package re-installation problems!

##**choco-package-list-backup (CPLB)** is a script I wrote that will backup the list of your currently installed Chocolatey packages and save them to a PACKAGES.CONFIG file. You can then use that PACKAGES.CONFIG file to re-install all your packages on another computer or even the same computer later if it crashes. "How can I re-install on the same computer if it crashed and I lost the PACKAGES.CONFIG file?" Thanks for asking! **CPLB** backs up your package list locally AND to multiple cloud services!

###FEATURES:
* **CPLB** supports saving PACKAGES.CONFIG to all of the following:
1. your local Documents folder
2. your Active Directory assigned HOMESHARE
3. Box
4. Dropbox Personal and Business
5. Google Drive and Drive File Stream
6. iCloudDrive
7. Microsoft OneDrive (free, paid consumer, and corporate)
8. NETGEAR ReadyCLOUD
9. Nextcloud
10. ownCloud
11. Resilio Sync
12. Seafile
13. TonidoSync
14. A custom location of your choice
15. C:\Users\Public when run from system account
* **CPLB** runs on install to make sure you have backup(s) right now!
* **CPLB** backups every Monday at 6 AM in the background to C:\Users\Public. Set it and forget it! 
* **CPLB** supports copying [InstChoco - The ULTIMATE Chocolatey and Chocolatey packages (re)installer!](https://chocolatey.org/packages/instchoco) to your PACKAGES.CONFIG backup location(s) for the fastest way ever to reinstall Chocolatey and your Chocolatey packages! (Or migrate!)
* **CPLB** supports backing up PERSISTENTPACKAGES.CONFIG if you are using [choco-persistent-packages](https://chocolatey.org/packages/choco-persistent-packages).
* **CPLB** integrates with [Chocolatey Shortcuts](https://chocolatey.org/packages/choco-shortcuts-winconfig).
* **CPLB** saves in computer (name) specific folders so you can backup your Chocolatey package list from multiple computers to the same cloud destination(s). No confusion over what computer gets what packages!
* **CPLB** saves a list of all your installed programs (AllProgramsList.txt) whether they were installed by Chocolatey or not.
* **CPLB** saves your pinned information to pins.bat for easy re-pinning packages.
* **CPLB** is in your path and ready to run.
* **CPLB** is configurable. You can:
1. configure which locations you want or don't want to save to (default=all the locations found except the custom location)
2. configure to save package version information or not (default=false)
     3. configure to append a date to the saved packages.config, AllProgramsList.txt, and pins.bat files(default=false)
4. configure what folder to save to (default=ChocolateyPackageListBackup)
5. easily add a custom location by editing CustomPath and UseCustomPath in the .xml configuration file
6. configure to save a list of all your installed Windows programs whether installed by Chocolatey or not to AllProgramsList.txt (default=true)
