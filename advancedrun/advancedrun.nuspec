AdvancedRun is a simple tool for Windows that allows you to run a program with different settings that you choose, including - low or high priority, start directory, main window state (Minimized/Maximized), run the program with different user or permissions, Operating system compatibility settings, and environment variables. You can also save the desired settings into a configuration file and then run the program automatically from command-line with the desired settings.
