**TCC** is our console mode Windows command shell (formerly known as 4NT). TCC is a replacement for the CMD command line (the default Windows command prompt). TCC is a superset of CMD, with 235+ internal commands (CMD has fewer than 40), 680+ internal variables and functions, and hundreds of enhancements to existing CMD commands.

TCC works with your existing command line applications and batch files, but offers major improvements in command line and batch file capabilities, and adds thousands of new features to your command prompt windows.

###Benefits
* TCC is a CMD replacement [command processor that is compatible with your existing CMD commands](https://jpsoft.com/help/index.htm?cmd_comp.htm) and [batch files](https://jpsoft.com/windows-batch-files.html), while adding thousands of new features. You're immediately more productive, and you can learn and add TCC's new features at your own pace.
* [Create and debug your batch scripts in a fraction of the time with the integrated editor and batch file debugger.](https://jpsoft.com/help/index.htm?ide__batch_debugger.htm)
* The integrated and familiar environment means you are immediately more productive with your interactive command prompt and batch file development tasks.
* The consistent syntax reduces your learning and development time.
* [The comprehensive help (including context-sensitive popup help for command line syntax), speeds your development time and reduces syntax errors.](https://jpsoft.com/help)

###Features
Too many to list due to nuspec description constraints. [Please view the website.](https://jpsoft.com/products/tcc-cmd-prompt.html)
