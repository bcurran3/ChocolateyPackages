## **choco-nuspec-checker** (**CNC**) is a PowerShell script I designed for Chocolatey package maintainers/creators to check Chocolatey .nuspec files for common errors and omissions... and automatically fix most of them! Find out AND FIX what the Chocolatey validator is going to tell you BEFORE you submit your package. **CNC** also goes beyond it's original scope and checks for common Chocolatey install/uninstall script errors and omissions as well.

### FEATURES:
* **CNC** checks all .nuspec elements and reports any missing or template default values
* **CNC** checks for all verifier messages (guidelines, suggestions, and notes) and reports them if applicable
* **CNC** checks for dead URLs and reports them
* **CNC** checks for GitHub direct links, reports them, and can convert them to various CDN URLs (default=Staticaly)
* **CNC** checks for RawGit CDN links, reports them, and can convert them to various CDN URLs (default=Staticaly)
* **CNC** can open all your .nuspec element URLs in your default browser for quick viewing
* **CNC** checks and reports current status of your package on chocolatey.org
* **CNC** can add a standard template header and/or footer to your .nuspec description and replace tokens in it
* **CNC** checks nuspec and PowerShell scripts for correct UTF-8 encoding and reports if the encoding is incorrect
* **CNC** can re-write your nuspec in UTF-8 w/o BOM format
* **CNC** can re-write your PowerShell scripts in UTF-8 w/ BOM format
* **CNC** checks all your PowerShell scripts for syntax errors
* **CNC** checks for and can add $ErrorActionPreference = 'Stop' to your PowerShell scripts
* **CNC** can optimize PNG files in your nuspec directory if PNGOptimizer.commandline is installed
* **CNC** can be run from the Command Prompt AND PowerShell

### Helps make packaging Chocolateasy!

### INSTRUCTIONS:
* **CNC -help** for help with options and switches
* Run **CNC** to check the .nuspec in your current directory, run **CNC X:\SOMEWHERE** to check the .nuspec in that directory. (Do not specify the file, just the directory.)
* To check all your packages' .nuspec files, change to the root directory of your packages, and via PowerShell run **Get-ChildItem | ?{if ($__.PSIsContainer){cls;CNC $__.Fullname;pause}}**
* To update all your packages' .nuspec files, change to the root directory of your packages, and via PowerShell run **Get-ChildItem | ?{if ($__.PSIsContainer){cls;CNC $__.Fullname -UpdateAll;pause}}** (no clear screen or pausing)

    <releaseNotes>
### CHANGELOG:
* 2020.09.15 - CNC will now ignore update.ps1 files.
* 2020.04.06.0001 - Updated CNC.cmd for ChocolateyToolsLocation handling. Fixed markdown heading error in CNCHeader.txt.
* 2020.04.06 - Better error handling when $env:ChocolateyToolsLocation is not defined. (Usually due to running under a different account than installed from.)
* 2020.01.16 - Updated message related to Markdown heading issues (now a requirement to fix), added Operating System index files checking, added verification that $env:ChocolateyToolsLocation exists (variable, not location)
* 2019.12.14 - Added checking for Markdown heading declarations that are incompatible with the Sept. 2019 changes to chocolatey.org. (Plan to autofix in a future update.)
* 2019.09.01 - Added Powershell v3 as a dependency due to Invoke-WebRequest use. Eliminated iwr error for new packages that weren't pushed to chocolatey.org yet, added reporting for packages that are in submitted or waiting for maintainer status, added to the common problems for not a valid XML file messages.

* 2019.02.04 - New -UpdateScripts will add EAP statement to script files and re-write out to UTF-8 w/BOM, New -UseGitHack, -UseGitCDN, and -UsejsDelivr allows you to use image CDNs other than Staticaly (default), **CNC** now gives a summary count of warnings and fixes, now checks for header/footer before adding so duplicates aren't created, now checks all PowerShell scripts (previously only chocolateyinstall/uninstall), cosmetic changes to highlight required changes
* 2019.01.29 - you can now use the following tokens in your header and footer files: $NuspecAuthors, $NuspecID, $NuspecOwners, $NuspecTitle, and $NuspecVersion - they will be parsed and replaced with the values from your nuspec file, added checking iconUrl image dimensions, new -OptimizePNGs option to run PNGOptimizerCL (if installed via Chocolatey) on PNG files in nuspec dir, added checking for lack of BOM in install/uninstall scripts, added checking for $ErrorActionPreference statement in install/uninstall scripts, now aborts when there are multiple nuspec files found in the same directory, now aborts if nuspec appears corrupt, cosmetic enhancements, now makes a backup file upon updates.

I will keep making it better though, of course.

### ROADMAP:
* native recurse option
* Check validity of URLs in description, checked by the package verifier as of 01/11/2020
* Reformat invalid Markdown headings automagically
* Could use a CNC...not updated...-WhatIf message when -UpdateXMLNamespace and -WhatIf are used
* https://github.com/chocolatey/package-validator/wiki/PackageInternalFilesIncluded -started
* option of displaying useful tips and tweaks (AutoHotKey, BeCyIconGrabber, PngOptimizer, Regshot, service viewer program, Sumo, etc)
* MAYBE do full params statement and get rid of args checking - low priority
* MAYBE check http links to see if https links are available and report if so - low priority
* MAYBE edit and re-write handling CDATA in description (not sure if there is a need)
* https://github.com/chocolatey/package-validator/wiki/ChecksumShouldBeUsed
* add packaging tips/tweaks/etc
* What else? (PRs accepted)
