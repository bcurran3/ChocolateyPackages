##**choco-nuspec-checker** (**CNC**) is a PowerShell script I designed for Chocolatey package maintainers/creators to check Chocolatey .nuspec files for common errors and omissions... and automatically fix most of them! Find out AND FIX what the Chocolatey validator is going to tell you BEFORE you submit your package. **CNC** also goes beyond it's original scope and checks for common Chocolatey install/uninstall script errors and omissions as well.

###FEATURES:
* **CNC** checks all .nuspec elements and reports any missing or template default values
* **CNC** checks for all verifier messages (guidelines, suggestions, and notes) and reports them if applicable
* **CNC** checks for dead URLs and reports them
* **CNC** checks for GitHub direct links, reports them, and can convert them to various CDN URLs (default=Staticaly)
* **CNC** checks for RawGit CDN links, reports them, and can convert them to various CDN URLs (default=Staticaly)
* **CNC** can open all your .nuspec element URLs in your default browser for quick viewing
* **CNC** can add a standard template header and/or footer to your .nuspec description and replace tokens in it
* **CNC** checks nuspec and PowerShell scripts for correct UTF-8 encoding and reports if the encoding is incorrect
* **CNC** can re-write your nuspec in UTF-8 w/o BOM format
* **CNC** can re-write your PowerShell scripts in UTF-8 w/ BOM format
* **CNC** checks all your PowerShell scripts for syntax errors
* **CNC** checks for and can add $ErrorActionPreference = 'Stop' to your PowerShell scripts
* **CNC** can optimize PNG files in your nuspec directory if PNGOptimizer.commandline is installed

###Helps make packaging Chocolateasy!

###INSTRUCTIONS:
* **CNC -help** for help with options and switches
* Run **CNC** to check the .nuspec in your current directory, run **CNC X:\SOMEWHERE** to check the .nuspec in that directory. (Do not specify the file, just the directory.)
* To check all your packages' .nuspec files, change to the root directory of your packages, and via PowerShell run **Get-ChildItem | ?{if ($__.PSIsContainer){cls;CNC $__.Fullname;pause}}**
* To update all your packages' .nuspec files, change to the root directory of your packages, and via PowerShell run **Get-ChildItem | ?{if ($__.PSIsContainer){cls;CNC $__.Fullname -UpdateAll;pause}}** (no clear screen or pausing)
