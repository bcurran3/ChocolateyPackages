Advanced BAT to EXE Converter is the best choice to compile your Batch Files to .EXE for distributing commercially.  Advanced BAT to EXE Converter not only encrypts your code, but also creates an actual native Windows .EXE program.  These .EXE do not require any pre-installed software to function and can be digitally signed. 

Even the most complex batch files can be instantly converted to executables with the included Intelli-Parse technology.  This reduces development time by making sure your EXE works exactly as the original batch file does.  You can embed your Company name and Copyright information to build your online reputation.  Use the "Include Version Info" feature when compiling your project. 

Advanced BAT to EXE Converter is the easiest and fastest way to develop and sell your own Windows apps!  There are many batch file examples that use unique extra commands included within the compiler.
