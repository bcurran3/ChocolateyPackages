**BCURRAN3'S PACKAGE NOTES:**

* This package downloads the installer via a version specific URL. It should never fail unless the version is completely removed from the vendor website.
* This has been tested with TVST (HD-TVI) and XVST (HD-SDI) MAGIC Series DVRs. It probably will work with UVST (EX-SDI) MAGIC Series DVRs as well.
* There are many OEM versions of this program. This one is probably specific to http://unixcctv.com/ and http://www.magicdvr.com/
* I personally use and endorse this program.
