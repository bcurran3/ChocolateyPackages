###Tweaking.com - Registry Compressor

For Windows XP, 2003, Vista, 2008, 7, 8, 8.1, 2012, 10 (32 &amp; 64 Bit)

First and foremost, this program does NOT remove or add anything to the registry. This is not a registry cleaner or scanner.

The Windows Registry is a hierarchical database that stores 
configuration settings and options on Microsoft Windows operating 
systems.

Just like databases the registry can become bloated and large when 
there has been a lot of additions and deletions from the registry. When 
this happens the system can become slower and use more CPU as 
programs and the operating system take longer to read and write to the 
registry, just like any other database.

This program does NOT remove or add anything to the registry. What it 
does is it rebuilds the registry to new files, when this happens all the 
overhead is gone and the registry is smaller and faster.

Microsoft offers a manual way to do this:

Thanks to this program you can now do it with one click. :-)
