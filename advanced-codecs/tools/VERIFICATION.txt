==================== Shark007's Advanced Codecs ====================

bcurran3 downloads and packages the executable for Shark007's Advanced Codecs from 
http://www.majorgeeks.com/files/details/win7codecs.html which is the official mirror.

Shark007's statement and current MD5 checksum can be found at http://shark007.net/win7codecs.html
along with a direct download link that has never worked for me since it appeared.
