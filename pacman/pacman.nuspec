Added joystick control

This game is Freeware
Pacman
written by PJ Crossley 2006

###Goal
The goal of this game is to remove all dots by eating them with your pacman. Ghosts try to eat you so you should avoid them. The Pills will help you. When you eat one of those the ghosts temporarily become afraid and can be chased for points. Also sometimes a bonus appears. Get the highest score and don't be eaten.

###Playing
* You steer your pacman using the arrow keys. You can  press the correct key before you reach the corridor (but keep it pressed).
* F4 toggle fullscreen
* Also the game is joystick compatible

###Levels
The game has Six  levels. At the end of the sixth you start again but the game becomes increasingly faster.
