## Detailed Description
**Note:** Installing this Intel generic graphics driver will overwrite your Computer Manufacturer (OEM) customized driver. OEM drivers are handpicked and include customized features and solutions to platform-specific issues. The generic Intel driver provides users the latest and greatest feature enhancements and bug fixes that OEMs may not have customized yet to address platform-specific needs. Users can check for matching OEM versions at OEM websites.

### Highlights

Get back on the pitch with eFootball PES 2021 Season update* and return to familiar ground and uncover the motivations behind the Covenant’s invasion of New Mombasa in Halo 3: ODST* on Intel® Iris® Plus graphics or better.

*2 Are you still experiencing an error preventing the driver update? Look here for why and a solution.

Any graphics issues found using Intel generic graphics drivers should be reported directly to Intel. Corporate customers should always use OEM drivers and report all issues through the vendor they purchased the platforms and support through.

Install the Intel® Driver &amp; Support Assistant, which automatically checks for drivers on a regular basis and can provide notifications when new drivers are available.

This is a DCH driver. Click for more information about DCH drivers.
