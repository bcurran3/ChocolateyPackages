Managing your favorite cloud storage services could not be easier. Simply provide login information, and all your cloud storage will automatically appear as a virtual drive every time you start your PC.

### NAS storage as a virtual drive
You can connect to NAS servers by WebDAV or FTP. Many NAS vendors recommend NetDrive as a standard way to mount their NAS products. Share your NAS easily with anyone as virtual drive.

### SFTP to securely transfer files
NetDrive supports secure file transfer by SFTP (SSH File Transfer protocol) . Unlike standard File Transfer Protocol (FTP), SFTP encrypt both commands and data, preventing passwords and sensitive information from being transmitted in clear text over a network.

### Works with AirDrive - Your Smartphone as a Disk Drive

Microsoft Windows 10, Windows 8, Windows 8.1, Windows 7, Windows Vista, Windows XP, Windows Server 2003/2008/2012.

#### You can freely download and install NetDrive on your computer for evaluation during the 30-day trial period.
#### Even after the trial period, you can continue using NetDrive but NetDrive will be limited to mount only one network drive, limited transfer speed and a banner will be displayed over the windows explorer indicating the trial is over.
