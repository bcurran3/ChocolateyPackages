Displays a system tray load indicator for your local physical disks.
Has a 5 bar resolution for both read and write operations.
Has a small memory footprint and low CPU utilisation.
Auto-calibrates itself to ensure that the output is relative to the disk usage for the previous 60 seconds (Read and write scales are not relative).
Shows a 'governor' to indicate wether the System Tray Icon is actually being updated.
Especially useful for situations where the (hardware) hard drive LED is hidden, missing or broken. Works inside of virtual machines.
Stand-alone executable.
PACKAGE NOTES: Works with Windows 2000 through Windows 10 and in virtual machines. Self contained package.
