**BCURRAN3'S PACKAGE NOTES:**

* A BCURRAN3 original! So of course I endorse and use it. :)
* Yes, I considered icons for more advanced functions such as to view and change Chocolatey Features, Sources, Pinning, and apikey. BUT (notice that's a big but) those are advanced commands that I feel the average user wouldn't need. The people who know what those things do are more likely to just go to the Command Prompt and do it there. A bigger reason why I didn't add this is that Windows 10 doesn't allow nested menus. So if I added another 3-9 shortcuts, it would be very cluttered. On Windows 7 the additional shortcuts could be managed nicely under a separate folder, I wish Windows 10 worked that way still.. If anyone requests it, I'd be glad to make a choco-shortcuts-advanced-winconfig with the more advanced commands and set this package as a dependency.

#This package creates Windows Start Menu shortcuts to run common Chocolatey functions.

###WHO IS THIS FOR?
 **Chocolatey Shortcuts** is designed for those who aren't comfortable with the Command Prompt or just don't like to type much. **Chocolatey Shortcuts** allows you to perform the most common Chocolatey functions right from the Windows Start Menu. The shortcuts still shell out to the Command Prompt to run, but **Chocolatey Shortcuts** is designed to be incredibly simple to use with minimal typing; install or remove a program in a few clicks and type in the package name. **Chocolatey Shortcuts** is also useful to support professionals who know the difficulty of getting end users to type in commands correctly, now you can just point them to the Windows Start Menu!

###WHY DO I NEED THIS?
If you're a power user or use the Command Line and/or PowerShell all the time, you probably don't; though the website links might be useful for remembering where to find various Chocolatey resources.

###FEATURES:
* Search for, install, and uninstall a package from the Windows Start Menu.
* List installed and outdated packages from the Windows Start Menu.
* Upgrade all installed packages from the Windows Start Menu

* View chocolatey.log from the Windows Start Menu.
* Website links to prominent Chocolatey information.
