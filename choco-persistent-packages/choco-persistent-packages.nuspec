    <description>
#**choco-persistent-packages** (re)installs any missing crucial Chocolatey packages that you designate as persistant packages. Uninstall a persistent package and it will be installed again ready for use the next day. 

###This package creates a Windows Scheduled Task to run "cinst $env:ChocolateyInstall\config\persistentpackages.config -y" every day at a time that you specify. And because sometimes package installations go wrong... it will also create a Windows Scheduled Task to run "taskkill /im choco.exe /f /t" to stop the Chocolatey (choco.exe) process and all child processes at a time you specify.

###WHO IS THIS FOR?
 **choco-persistent-packages** is designed for [Chocolatey Pro](https://chocolatey.org/pricing) and [Chocolatey Business](https://chocolatey.org/pricing) licensed users who's computers are not necessarily under [Active Directory Directory Services Group Policy](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh147307(v=ws.10).aspx) control or other system mananagement utilities that can enforce software installation and desired state.

###WHY DO I NEED THIS?
If you have users/employees/a friend/a little brother/etc. that uninstalls programs/Chocolatey packages that you don't want uninstalled, **choco-persistent-packages** will (re)install those programs/Chocolatey packages that you deem necessary to keep installed. Basically you create a list of important packages and **choco-persistent-packages** will reinstall them every day if they are missing.

###WHY DO I NEED TO BE A CHOCOLATEY PRO OR BUSINESS USER?

You don't. But **choco-persistent-packages** will only work if the Chocolatey package data is missing. If a program is uninstalled outside of Chocolatey via Programs and Features this will not have any effect as Chocolatey and **choco-persistent-packages** will not know the program has been uninstalled. Chocolatey Pro and Business editions include a feature called [Package Synchronizer - Automatic Sync](https://chocolatey.org/docs/features-synchronize) which removes the Chocolatey package data when a program is uninstalled via Programs and Features. After this synchronization occurs (every execution of choco.exe), **choco-persistent-packages** will see the program/package missing and reinstall it at the designated time.
	
###INSTALL INSTRUCTIONS:
You can install **choco-persistent-packages** with TIME and ABORTTIME parameters to make it run daily at your preferred time. If you enter no parameters at all, **choco-persistent-packages** will default to run at midnight every day and abort the process at 1 AM. When entering the TIME and ABORTTIME parameters, use "[Military Time](http://militarytimechart.com/)." Not entering the correct format will fail the install. Please see the examples below.

###INSTALL EXAMPLES:
* **choco install choco-persistent-packages --params "'/TIME:04:00'"** - (re)installs persistent packages at 4 AM and aborts at 1 AM 21 hours later.
* **choco install choco-persistent-packages --params "'/TIME:06:30 /ABORTTIME:08:30'"** - (re)installs persistent packages at 6:30 AM and aborts at 8:30 AM.

####A NOTE ON DEFAULTS:
* If you don't specify any parameters, **choco-persistent-packages** defaults to running daily at midnight and aborting at 1 AM. (My preference!)
* Not specifying a TIME will always default to midnight. Not specifying an ABORTTIME will always default to 1 AM. If you're setting a TIME, be sure to also set the ABORTTIME. 

###POST INSTALL INSTRUCTIONS:
* Edit \ProgramData\Chocolatey\config\persistentpackages.config and read the comments section.

If you have a previous release of **choco-persistent-packages** installed, upgrading to a new version will NOT modify your current scheduled task or list of persistent packages. You will need to uninstall and re-install to take advantage of the new ABORTTIME feature.
