ReadyNAS Remote lets you access your storage system anywhere you have Internet access.
With ReadyNAS Remote, you can drag and drop files between your ReadyNAS system and your
computer or smartphone as though they were on the same LAN.

Data transmission over the Internet goes through an encrypted tunnel, so your data stays private
as it transfers to and from your ReadyNAS system.	

PACKAGING NOTES: Uninstall is not silent (requires clicking finish). This package will NOT upgrade or reinstall well as it uninstalls the previous version first and the package is not currently scripted to handle that. Not compatible with ReadyCLOUD package (ReadyNAS Remote will uninstall ReadyCLOUD and this is not scripted to handle it).
