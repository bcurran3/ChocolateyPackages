#InstChoco - The ULTIMATE Chocolatey and Chocolatey packages (re)installer!
	
##QUESTION: "Why do I need an installer for Chocolatey when I already have Chocolatey installed?"

##ANSWER: You need InstChoco for the NEXT time you want to install Chocolatey and automate package (re)installation!

**InstChoco** is the evolution of an old batch file I’ve used over the years to automate installing Chocolatey followed by a bunch of "choco install packagename -y" commands to install my standard toolset of programs. In 2017 I turned that old batch file into a program with many additional features. Thus, **InstChoco** was born. I also integrated **InstChoco** with other Chocolatey packages I've created. **InstChoco** is especially useful when used along with [Choco Package List Backup to Local and Cloud](https://chocolatey.org/packages/choco-package-list-backup). What you see now is the culmination of many long hard hours of work making **InstChoco** the ULTIMATE Chocolatey and Chocolatey packages (re)installer! **InstChoco** is extremely feature rich, but I'm always open to new ideas and features. Feel free to [contact me](https://chocolatey.org/packages/InstChoco/ContactOwners) with feedback or suggestions.
