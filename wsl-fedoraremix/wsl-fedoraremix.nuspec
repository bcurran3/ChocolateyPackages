### Fedora Remix for Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)

Fedora Remix for WSL is a remix of upstream [Fedora](https://getfedora.org/) software for [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://github.com/sirredbeard/Awesome-WSL) on Windows 10 and Windows 10 Server.

Fedora Remix for WSL is powered by [Pengwin Enterprise](https://github.com/WhitewaterFoundry/Pengwin-Enterprise) from [Whitewater Foundry](https://www.whitewaterfoundry.com/). Fedora Remix for WSL is not endorsed by the Fedora Project or Red Hat, Inc. but is provided under the [Fedora Remix](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Remix) program.

Fedora Remix for WSL contains modifications to the official Fedora distribution. The unmodified Fedora distribution can be obtained [here](https://getfedora.org/). Fedora Remix for WSL does not contain wlinux-setup or other [features](https://github.com/WhitewaterFoundry/WLinux#features) of [WLinux](https://github.com/WhitewaterFoundry/WLinux).

Fedora Remix for WSL is provided on a community-support basis. There is no support available for Fedora Remix for WSL from the Fedora community other than that which is offered to all users.

### Differences from upstream Fedora:

* Fedora Remix for WSL is based on the [@core package group](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/SIGs/Minimal_Core) from Fedora.
* The following packages have been removed from the default install of Fedora Remix for WSL: grub, plymouth, kernel, sssd, linux-firmware, dracut, parted, e2fsprogs, iprutils, ppc64-utils, selinux-policy, policycoreutils, sendmail, man-db, firewalld, fedora-release, fedora-logos, and fedora-release-notes.
* The following non-default package has been added to the default install to comply with the terms of the Fedora Remix program: generic-release.
* The following configuration files have custom settings applied for the WSL environment: /etc/wsl.conf, /etc/local.conf, /etc/profile.
* The following files have been removed and will be automatically re-generated if/as needed: /etc/resolv.conf, /boot, and /var/cache/dnf/*.
* The following custom package have been added to enhance the WSL experience: wslutilities, https://github.com/wslutilities/wslu.

### Troubleshooting and support options:

1. Basic troubleshooting will solve many problems encountered with WSL.
2. You can search for your issue in the main WSL issues page.
3. You may also open an issue here on our GitHub page for community support.

Whitewater Foundry devs monitor the Fedora Remix for WSL GitHub issues page however users who require dedicated end-user support for WSL should consider [WLinux](https://github.com/WhitewaterFoundry/WLinux) instead. Businesses and other organizations who would like to recieve professional ongoing support should [e-mail us](mailto:enterprise@whitewaterfoundry.com) or visit [our website](https://www.whitewaterfoundry.com/wlinux-enterprise-edition/) to learn more about WLinux Enterprise.
