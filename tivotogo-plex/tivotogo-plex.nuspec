    <summary>TiVo plug-in for Plex</summary>
    <description>
This Plex plugin uses the TiVo To Go API to watch a stream off a TiVo or to download a recorded program from the TiVo. It requires a Series 2 or newer TiVo with an ethernet connection. The Plex Server needs to have a high speed connection between itself and the TiVo.

Q: What would I use this channel for?

A: You browse to a show on your TiVo and watch it without downloading it to the Plex Server.

Q: Can I download something from the TiVo it to the Plex Server using this channel?

A: Yes! If you enable the TiVoToGo service, and fill in a folder name, the channel will have extra entries to allow you to download the content.

NOTE: You should create a library on your Plex server which points to the same directory which you are downloading the file into. If you name the Plex library "TiVo To Go" it will automatically get refreshed when downloads are initiated and when they complete. If you decide to name the Plex library something different simply add that name in the TiVoToGo preferences.

Requires:

Linux, OSX or Windows Plex Server (No ARM Processor NAS support)
On Linux, OSX or X86 NAS requires curl be installed
To Do:

Use the urllib instead of curl
Stop using /tmp/cookies.txt
Use dynamic sockets and a fixed URL for the live stream video
If the community support for the MPEG-TS improves, add MPEG-TS support, for now it only works with MPEG-PS
Installation Instructions

Install curl if you don't already have it
Copy TiVoToGo.bundle to your plugin directory
Mac: ~/Library/Application Support/Plex Media Server/Plug-ins
Windows: C:\Users\[user]\AppData\Local\Plex Media Server\Plug-ins
Linux: /var/lib/plexmediaserver/Library/Application Support/Plex Media Server/Plug-ins
Make sure to update the plugins settings
Enter your Media Access Key from the TiVo
Enter a IP address for the TiVo if the Plex Server is on a different subnet and then exit the channel and enter it again.
If you want enable the To Go offline download check the box and fill in a directory that is writable by the plex user.
