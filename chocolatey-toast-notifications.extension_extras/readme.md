###It's HERE! The 100% Chocolatey user OPT-IN toast notification extension for Chocolatey and Windows 10 (only).

##**Chocolatey Toast Notifications Extension** is a Chocolatey extension that displays a toast notification after installing or uninstalling a program. This extension will start working automatically once installed and does NOT need to be implemented by package creators/maintainers. **Chocolatey Toast Notifications Extension** is meant to be installed and used directly by Chocolatey end users.

###PURPOSE:

* Chocogeeky fun!

###FEATURES: 
* **Chocolatey Toast Notifications Extension** will display a toast notification with the package name, program name, program version, status message (installed or uninstalled), and a link to the package page on the chocolatey.org website after a program is installed or uninstalled.

###WHAT IT WON'T DO:
* **Chocolatey Toast Notifications Extension** will NOT work on anything other than Windows 10, this is a limitation of the [BurntToast](https://github.com/Windos/BurntToast) PowerShell module and its use of the [UWP Community Toolkit](https://github.com/Microsoft/WindowsCommunityToolkit). (Yes, I tried it on Windows Server 2016 and it did NOT work.)
* **Chocolatey Toast Notifications Extension** will NOT display messages for programs that don't use standard installers, i.e. portable programs.
* **Chocolatey Toast Notifications Extension** will NOT display messages for programs installed/uninstalled via any background processes; i.e. my **[choco-upgrade-all-at-startup](https://chocolatey.org/packages/choco-upgrade-all-at-startup)**, **[choco-upgrade-all-at](https://chocolatey.org/packages/choco-upgrade-all-at)**, and **[choco-persistent-packages](https://chocolatey.org/packages/choco-persistent-packages)** packages... YET!
