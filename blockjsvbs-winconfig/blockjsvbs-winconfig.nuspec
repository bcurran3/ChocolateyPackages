    <description>
**blockjsvbs-winconfig** helps protect you from malware payloads delivered using [JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript) and [VBScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VBScript). It does this by simply reassociating the related file extensions (.js, .jse, .vbs, .vbe) to open up in your default text editor (most likely Notepad or Wordpad) instead of executing the scripts via their native script engines. 

**blockjsvbs-winconfig** is only one step in helping to protect your computer from malware. There are many more file extensions that you may want to reassociate or disassociate completely. You can simply do this for more file extensions by looking at the ChocolateyInstall and ChocolateyUninstall scripts or read about the [assoc](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/assoc) command.

**blockjsvbs-winconfig** is global. You only need to run it once and it will help protect all users of the computer.

Uninstalling **blockjsvbs-winconfig** will revert the file associations back to default.
