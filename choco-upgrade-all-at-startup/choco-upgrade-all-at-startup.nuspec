#DO YOU WANT TO UPGRADE YOUR CHOCOLATEY PACKAGES EVERY TIME YOUR COMPUTER BOOTS? 

#YOU JUST FOUND THE EASY WAY!
	
###This package creates a Windows Scheduled Task to run "choco upgrade all -y" every time your computer boots.

Please understand your computer boot time will increase. If you reboot daily, you'll probably never notice. If you reboot infrequently, you'll notice a slow down as packages are downloaded and updated/installed, especially if you have a slow Internet connection. Because of this **choco-upgrade-all-at-startup** is pseudo-deprecated and pseudo-superseded by **[choco upgrade all at](https://chocolatey.org/packages/choco-upgrade-all-at)** which allows you to set a time to run "choco upgrade all -y" every day in the wee hours of morning while you're happily dreaming of owning a supercomputer instead of twiddling your thumbs waiting for your "slow" computer to boot up. Otherwise it works wonderfully at keeping your Chocolatey installed programs up to date. 

SYSADMINS: I recommend use of **choco-upgrade-all-at-startup** for notebook/laptop users who tend to shut down their computers at night and thus miss scheduled updates/maintenance such as **[choco upgrade all at](https://chocolatey.org/packages/choco-upgrade-all-at)** (in the wee hours of the morning).
