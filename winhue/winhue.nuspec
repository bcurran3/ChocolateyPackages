###Introduction
WinHue is a desktop application that can control the Philips Hue lighting system. It is easy to install and use, and is one of the few fully-featured Hue apps on Windows.

Plus, it's FREE!

###Edit Everything
Many items on the Hue bridge can be created, modified and deleted. These include:

* Groups
* Schedules
* Scenes
* Rules
* Sensors
* More!

Timer and schedules can also be set to recurr at certain times!

###Full Control
WinHue allows ultimate control of lights and groups.

* Name
* Color
* Brightness
* White Temperature
* Saturation

Quick and easy setup with support for multiple bridges means you'll be up and running with little more than a tap of the push-link button on your bridge.

###And Finally...
WinHue also has a fully-featured console application bundled with the installer.
