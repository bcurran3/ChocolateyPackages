Not met this package manager, but you can roll SSRP out using a silent install option anyway. 

There have been suggestions from site admins that  central adminstration of policies would be useful, and this is maybe something we'll look into. 

We don't offer direct download links. The present setup is designed to keep robots out, a protection which has unfortunately become necessary. Basically when you click the link, a php script runs that does various checks  before allowing you to download the file. 

There is no restriction on hosting a copy elsewhere, though. 

Regards, Ian.
