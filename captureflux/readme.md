**BCURRAN3'S PACKAGE NOTES:**

* This package downloads the .ZIP file via a version specific URL. It should never fail unless the version is completely removed from the vendor website.
* v6.0.5 "is an early release that will continue to evolve during the next days. It's worth a try because of many improvements (see the readme file included)"
* I personally use and endorse this program (v5.2.3). I use it to capture video from a MiniDV camcorder into the computer in native format.
* Works fine on Windows 10.
