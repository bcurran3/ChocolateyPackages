#choco-package-list-backup solves your Chocolatey migration and package re-installation problems!

**choco-package-list-backup** is a script I wrote that will backup the list of your currently installed Chocolatey packages and save them to a PACKAGES.CONFIG file. You can then use that PACKAGES.CONFIG file to re-install all your packages on another computer or even the same computer later if it crashes. "How can I re-install on the same computer if it crashed and I lost the PACKAGES.CONFIG file?" Thanks for asking! **choco-package-list-backup** backs up your package list locally and to multiple cloud services!

###FEATURES:

Set it and forget it! **choco-package-list-backup** backups up your Chocolatey packages list every Monday at 6 AM in the background so you don't have to be bothered with it.

**choco-package-list-backup** supports saving PACKAGES.CONFIG to all of the following:

* your local Documents folder
* your Active Directory assigned HOMESHARE
* Box
* Dropbox Personal and Business
* Google Drive and Drive File Stream
* iCloudDrive
* Microsoft OneDrive
* NETGEAR ReadyCLOUD
* Nextcloud
* ownCloud
* Resilio Sync
* Seafile
* TonidoSync
* A custom location of your choice
* more coming - Let me know what you want/need!

**choco-package-list-backup** runs on install to make sure you have backup(s) right now! (SYSADMINS READ: Make this your last package installed!)

**choco-package-list-backup** supports copying [InstChoco](https://chocolatey.org/packages/instchoco) with the PACKAGES.CONFIG path for the fastest way ever to reinstall Chocolatey and your Chocolatey packages! (Or migrate!)

**choco-package-list-backup** supports backing up PERSISTENTPACKAGES.CONFIG if you are using [choco-persistent-packages](https://chocolatey.org/packages/choco-persistent-packages)

**choco-package-list-backup** integrates with [Chocolatey Shortcuts](https://chocolatey.org/packages/choco-shortcuts-winconfig) if installed.

**choco-package-list-backup** saves in computer (name) specific folders so you can backup your Chocolatey package list from multiple computers to the same cloud destination(s). No confusion over what computer gets what packages!

**choco-package-list-backup** saves a list of all your installed programs (AllProgramsList.txt) whether they were installed by Chocolatey or not.

**choco-package-list-backup** is configurable. You can:

* configure which locations you want or don't want to save to (default=all the locations found except the custom location)
* configure to save package version information or not (default=false)
* configure to append a date to the saved packages.config and AllProgramsList.txt files(default=false)
* configure what folder to save to (default=ChocolateyPackageListBackup)
* easily add a custom location by editing CustomPath and UseCustomPath in the .xml configuration file
* configure to save a list of all your installed Windows programs whether installed by Chocolatey or not to AllProgramsList.txt (default=true)

**choco-package-list-backup** and choco-package-list-backup.xml are saved to Chocolatey's bin folder (\ProgramData\chocolatey\bin), so **choco-package-list-backup** is in your path.
