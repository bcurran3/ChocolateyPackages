## Detailed Description
**Note:** Installing this Intel generic graphics driver will overwrite your Computer Manufacturer (OEM) customized driver. OEM drivers are handpicked and include customized features and solutions to platform-specific issues. The generic Intel driver provides users the latest and greatest feature enhancements and bug fixes that OEMs may not have customized yet to address platform-specific needs. Users can check for matching OEM versions at OEM websites.

Any graphics issues found using Intel generic graphics drivers should be [reported directly to Intel](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/contact-support.html). Corporate customers should always use OEM drivers and report all issues through the vendor they purchased the platforms and support through.

Install the [Intel® Driver &amp; Support Assistant](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/detect.html), which automatically checks for drivers on a regular basis and can provide notifications when new drivers are available.
