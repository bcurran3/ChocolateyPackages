###Overview

Password Control is a tool designed to allow helpdesk staff and other IT support personnel to reset user passwords.  It has a simple and intuitive interface that many users find more productive than a custom MMC console.  Password Control is designed to work with **Active Directory** based domains.  It also features other functions such as the ability to enable and disable user accounts (you can edit a config file to remove these features if required). 

The "G" button shown in the screenshot above (next to the password box) is used to generate random passwords.  By default the generated password will contain a random combination of upper case and lower case characters and digits.  Symbols can also be included and you can alter the length of the password generated above that of your minimum password length setting.  You can also choose to use a "pass phrase" or a custom password mask.  A pass phrase is simply a combination of two words seperated by a space. A mask gives you the ability to set the exact format of the password. e.g. 5 lowercase characters followed by 2 digits, A random word followed by 3 digits, a specific password etc.

Please read [this](http://www.wisesoft.co.uk/software/passwordcontrol/basics.aspx) document to help you get started.
