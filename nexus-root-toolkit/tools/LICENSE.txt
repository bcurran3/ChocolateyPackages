Under the Donate page at http://www.wugfresh.com/donate/ it is stated:

"I release my software freely to the community but I work very hard in my limited free time to keep this software updated with the latest android builds and Nexus devices; I try my best to listen to feedback and continue to add new features.  I am opposed to adding ads in this app/installer despite all the time I spend on this, so I am hoping that if you like my work and/or I have helped you in anyway, that you please consider making a small donation. Your help and support is greatly appreciated.  Thank you!"
