Many of the tools have been built with making certain repair, cleanup and tasks easier, faster and better.

More and more tools will be added to the program over time. Many of the tools have so many options, control and features that they could have been full programs on their own. But the goal was to have everything in one spot.

Instead of repeating all of the tools and what they can do, you can view the online help for the program. You can also view the tips and tricks section of the help file to see a few of the little extra features added to the program.
