###About

Desktop Notifications allows you to read your Android notifications on your desktop. Instead of checking notifications directly on your phone, you can read them while working on your computer. The app was developed as part of a research project at the Human Computer Interaction (hciLab) group at the University of Stuttgart (Germany).

The app was featured on Lifehacker, Golem.de, GoogleWatchBlog and many other blogs!
