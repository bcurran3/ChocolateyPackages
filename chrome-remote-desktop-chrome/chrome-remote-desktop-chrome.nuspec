###Access other computers or allow another user to access your computer securely over the Internet.

Chrome Remote Desktop allows users to remotely access another computer through Chrome browser or a Chromebook.

All connections are fully secured.

Chrome Remote Desktop is fully cross-platform.  Provide remote assistance to Windows, Mac and Linux users, or access your Windows (XP and above) and Mac (OS X 10.6 and above) desktops at any time, all from the Chrome browser on virtually any device, including Chromebooks.
