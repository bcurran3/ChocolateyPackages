**After installing LAN Speed Test v4.0, it begins in (Lite) mode.** LAN Speed Test (Lite) is fully functional with no time limits, etc. - only some of the more advanced features are disabled.

LAN Speed Test was designed from the ground up to be a simple but powerful tool for measuring file transfer, hard drive, USB Drive, and Local Area Network (LAN) speeds (wired and wireless). It does this by building a file in memory, then transfers it both ways (without effects of Windows/Mac file caching) while keeping track of the time, and then does the calculations for you. Simple concept and easy to use. You'll find that LAN Speed Test will quickly become one of your favorite network tools!
