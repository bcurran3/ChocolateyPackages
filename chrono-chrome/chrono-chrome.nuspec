Chrono Download Manager is the first (and only) full-featured download manager for Google Chrome. All your download management is done inside a browser tab instead of by installing a separate download managing application. Chrono is tightly integrated with Chrome by context menus, toolbar buttons and key shortcuts.	

Besides download management, Chrono is also your best video download helper and bulk image downloader. The Chrono Sniffer detects all links, images, audios and videos on a webpage, and you can filter URLs by their file types or by Regular Expression.

Start downloading with Chrono today! Have fun playing with it, and don't forget to share!
