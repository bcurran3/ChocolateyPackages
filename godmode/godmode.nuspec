The Windows Master Control Panel shortcut, labeled All Tasks and also called Windows God Mode by bloggers and All Tasks folder by at least one Microsoft developer,[1] is a short-cut to access various control settings in Windows Vista and later operating systems. By creating a folder with a certain name, users have access to all of the operating system's control panels from within a single folder. The hack was published outside of Microsoft documentation in 2007[2] and gained popularity when the name God Mode was used by bloggers. Variations of the same method can access different settings, and have also been called “God Mode” folders.

#### There is no software to install, this simply creates the GodMode icon on the current users's desktop.
