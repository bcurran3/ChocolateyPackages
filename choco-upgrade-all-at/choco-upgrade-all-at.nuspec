#DO YOU WANT TO UPGRADE YOUR CHOCOLATEY PACKAGES EVERY DAY? OR MAYBE EVERY WEEK?

#YOU JUST FOUND THE EASY WAY!
	
###This package creates a Windows Scheduled Task to run "choco upgrade all -y" at a time and frequency you specify. And because sometimes package installations go wrong... it will also create a Windows Scheduled Task to run "taskkill /im choco.exe /f /t" to stop the Chocolatey (choco.exe) process and all child processes at a time you specify.

This package is a pseudo replacement for [choco-upgrade-all-at-startup](https://chocolatey.org/packages/choco-upgrade-all-at-startup).

###INSTRUCTIONS:
You can install **choco-upgrade-all-at** with multiple parameters to make it run "choco upgrade all -y" daily or weekly (Monthly is just not often enough!) at your preferred time. If you enter no parameters at all, **choco-upgrade-all-at** will default to run "choco upgrade all -y" at 2 AM every day and abort the process at 4 AM. When entering the TIME and ABORTTIME parameters, use "[Military Time](http://militarytimechart.com/)." When entering the DAILY or WEEKLY parameter you can actually use anything, "yes" just makes sense though. When using the WEEKLY parameter, DAYS are entered as MON, TUE, WED, THU, FRI, SAT, or SUN. Not entering the correct format will fail the install. Please see the examples below.

###INSTALL EXAMPLES:
* **choco install choco-upgrade-all-at --params "'/TIME:23:00'"** - runs "choco upgrade all -y" daily (default) at 11 PM and aborts at 4 AM, technically 19 hours earlier but will also result in 5 hours later.
* **choco install choco-upgrade-all-at --params "'/DAILY:yes /TIME:04:00 /ABORTTIME:08:00'"** - runs "choco upgrade all -y" daily at 4 AM and aborts it at 8 AM.
* **choco install choco-upgrade-all-at --params "'/WEEKLY:yes /DAY:SUN /TIME:01:00'"** - runs "choco upgrade all -y" every Sunday at 1 AM and aborts at 4 AM.

####A NOTE ON DEFAULTS:
* If you don't specify any parameters, **choco-upgrade-all-at** defaults to running daily at 2AM and aborting at 4 AM. (My preference!) 
* Not specifying a TIME will always default to 2 AM. Not specifying an ABORTTIME will always default to 4 AM. If you're setting a TIME, be sure to also set the ABORTTIME.
* When WEEKLY is specified but a DAY isn't, default first run will be a week from installation date; i.e. next week on whatever day of the week you installed the package.

####IF UPGRADING FROM A VERSION EARLIER THAN 0.0.4:
* Your old scheduled task will be deleted and replaced with default (mentioned above) parameters. To ensure **choco-upgrade-all-at** runs when you want it to, you should uninstall and reinstall with the settings you prefer.
* I have not tested with useRememberedArgumentsForUpgrades, you might get daily still with your preferred time.

####IF UPGRADING FROM VERSION 0.0.4 or 0.0.4.1:
* You're old scheduled task will be kept. You will need to uninstall and re-install to take advantage of the new ABORTTIME feature.
