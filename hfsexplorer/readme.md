**BCURRAN3'S PACKAGE NOTES:**

* As of v0.23.1.20200909 binaries are included in the package. No more URL downloads. This version will always be available to install.
* For those who are "upgrading" from v0.23.1 to v0.23.1.20200909; it will not be silent. The installer will ask permission to uninstall the "old" version. You'll have to go through it manually. Thi sis a 5 year old program with no updates, I'm just not willing to put the time into adding an AHK script to cover re-installation. Sorry. 
* This program does not support silent uninstall; it will pop up a dialogue asking if you're sure.
