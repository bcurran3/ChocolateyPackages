###WHAT'S THIS ALL ABOUT?

This package is for those who want to make their Microsoft Office installation more secure by disabling macros. Macros are a common method used by [ransomware viruses](https://cloudblogs.microsoft.com/microsoftsecure/2016/03/22/new-feature-in-office-2016-can-block-macros-and-help-prevent-infection/). If you don't have a need for them, you should disable them! This package is designed for "normal" users as well as sysadmins who have to constantly configure computers and make sure they are all the same. Sure, sysadmins could use GPO to do this, but not all computers are in a domain. Good thing you have access to Chocolatey! I put Chocolatey on just about every box I touch... so I made this Chocolatey package for super simple disabling of Office macros, well, really so I can add it to my setup scripts. This is part of a series of "-winconfig" packages for configuration automation. Others include [desktopicons-winconfig](https://chocolatey.org/packages/desktopicons-winconfig), [explorer-winconfig](https://chocolatey.org/packages/explorer-winconfig), [homepages-winconfig](https://chocolatey.org/packages/homepages-winconfig), and [taskbar-winconfig](https://chocolatey.org/packages/taskbar-winconfig)
