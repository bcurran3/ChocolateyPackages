These include USB storage you can wirelessly access at home, free software to easily backup your PC or Mac, wirelessly printing from any PC or Mac and the ability to play, view, listen to, and share your videos, photos, and music on DNLA connected TVs, game consoles, or media players.

The ReadySHARE Printer utility lets you share a USB printer that is connected to a USB port on
your router. You can share this USB printer among the Windows and Mac computers on your
