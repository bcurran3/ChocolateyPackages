kmttg is a Java based program I wrote to facilitate TivoToGo (TTG) transfers that can download, create pyTivo metadata, decrypt, run comskip and comcut (commercial detection and removal), create closed captions files and re-encode multiple shows you select from your Tivos all automatically. The program also has the capability to transfer and process shows automatically from your Tivos based on titles and keywords you setup.

kmttg also has an advanced Remote Control which among many other things allows for Season Pass management, backup/restore, copying, etc. Also now has capability to backup/restore Thumbs ratings.

Also has AutoSkip functionality where you can enjoy hands free commercial skip viewing on your TiVos.

Also has ability to capture video output directly from Slingbox Pro or later models either on the LAN or WAN.
