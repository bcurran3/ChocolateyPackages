###About this Add-on
* Real-time protection from dangerous links and websites
* Must-have addition to your antivirus

WOT protects you while you browse, warning you against dangerous links, websites, scams, malware, phishing, and more.

####How it works

* WOT displays donuts that show website safety ratings on every site you visit, and next to links to other sites.
* Red indicates potential danger
* Yellow tells you to be careful
* Green means it’s a safe website

☞ See safety ratings as you search Google, browse social media and check your email, and avoid clicking on dangerous links.

☞ Every site has a WOT Scorecard, which shows details about each rating and comments from other WOT users.

☞ WOT offers an additional layer of protection with Warning Screens, which offer you to “go back” before you land on a dangerous site. And you can turn off these warnings if you prefer not to see them.

☞ Real-time Protection
WOT has 2 modes: Real-time Protection and Manual Mode. Real-time Protection allows you to safe search the internet, enhancing your web security by actively notifying you of online security threats such as scams, malware, and phishing

####Where do the safety ratings come from?
Millions of WOT users rate websites for trustworthiness and safety. These ratings are processed by our unique algorithms and used to calculate each site’s Trust Score.

####Can you contribute to WOT ratings?
Yes. Download WOT and create an account to leave comments on each site’s scorecard. Read more
