## **choco-nuspec-checker** (**CNC**) is a PowerShell script I designed for Chocolatey package maintainers/creators to check Chocolatey .nuspec files for common errors and omissions... and automatically fix most of them! Find out AND FIX what the Chocolatey validator is going to tell you BEFORE you submit your package. **CNC** also goes beyond it's original scope and checks for common Chocolatey install/uninstall script errors and omissions as well.

### FEATURES:
* **CNC** checks all .nuspec elements and reports any missing or template default values, now recursively too!
* **CNC** checks for all verifier messages (guidelines, suggestions, and notes) and reports them if applicable
* **CNC** checks for dead URLs and reports them
* **CNC** checks for GitHub direct links, reports them, and can convert them to various CDN URLs (default=Staticaly)
* **CNC** checks for RawGit CDN links, reports them, and can convert them to various CDN URLs (default=Staticaly)
* **CNC** can open all your .nuspec element URLs in your default browser for quick viewing
* **CNC** checks and reports current status of your package on chocolatey.org
* **CNC** can add a standard template header, footer, and/or package notes to your .nuspec description with variables
* **CNC** checks nuspec and PowerShell scripts for correct UTF-8 encoding and reports if the encoding is incorrect
* **CNC** can re-write your nuspec in UTF-8 w/o BOM format
* **CNC** can re-write your PowerShell scripts in UTF-8 w/ BOM format
* **CNC** checks all your PowerShell scripts for syntax errors
* **CNC** checks chocolateyInstall.ps1 for improper use of Install-ChocolateyPackage and Install-ChocolateyZipPackage when binaries are included
* **CNC** checks for and can add $ErrorActionPreference = 'Stop' to your PowerShell scripts
* **CNC** can optimize image files in your nuspec directory
* **CNC** can be run from the Command Prompt AND PowerShell
* **CNC** and more...

### Helps make packaging Chocolateasy!

### INSTRUCTIONS:
* **CNC -help** for help with options and switches
* Run **CNC** to check the .nuspec in your current directory or run **CNC X:\SOMEWHERE** to check the .nuspec in that directory. (Do not specify the file, just the directory.)

### ROADMAP:

* Update CDN checking for "main" as well as "master" post 10/2020 (did this happen?)
* Check validity of URLs in description, checked by the package verifier as of 01/11/2020
* Reformat invalid Markdown headings automagically (Need to parse out and skip URLs.)
* Add option of displaying useful tips and tweaks (AutoHotKey, BeCyIconGrabber, PngOptimizer, Regshot, service viewer program, etc)
* MAYBE edit and re-write handling CDATA in description (not sure if there is a need)
* Possibly add option to run scripts through PSScriptAnalyzer
* What else? (PRs accepted)
