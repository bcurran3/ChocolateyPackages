##**Chocolatey Preinstaller Checks Extension** is a Chocolatey extension that intercepts and runs checks before installing or uninstalling a program. This extension will start working automatically once installed and does NOT need to be implemented by package creators/maintainers. **Chocolatey Preinstaller Checks Extension** is meant to be installed and used directly by Chocolatey end users.

###PURPOSE:

This extension attempts to head off problems related to:

* [https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/544](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/544)
* [https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/619](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/619)
* [https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/761](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/761)
* [https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/780](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/780)
* [https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/1526](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/1526)
* [https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/1548](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/1548)
* [https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/1579](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/1579)
* and possibly others until such time that Chocolatey natively handles these issues better and this extension becomes moot. (Rumored to be 1.0.0 milestone)

**Chocolatey Preinstaller Checks Extension**'s main purpose is to fend off specific types of problems before they occur. Currently Chocolatey (choco.exe) is not multi-instance friendly. If you try to install or uninstall packages using choco.exe in two Command Prompts at the same time, strange (bad!) things may occur. **Chocolatey Preinstaller Checks Extension** can avoid these strange (bad!) things by intercepting calls to install and uninstall programs and warn about the situation, wait for previous instances to finish, or abort; totally configurable. **Chocolatey Preinstaller Checks Extension** also checks Windows Installer to see if it's busy and will warn, make MSI installer and uninstaller programs wait until Windows Installer has finished processing the other program, or abort. **Chocolatey Preinstaller Checks Extension** only runs before PROGRAM installations and uninstallations. It does not perform any functions related to portable packages or other choco commands.

###FEATURES: 
* **Chocolatey Preinstaller Checks Extension** is completely configurable to warn, wait, or abort.
* **Chocolatey Preinstaller Checks Extension** will check if there is a pending reboot and warn you about it if so.
* **Chocolatey Preinstaller Checks Extension** will check if Windows Installer is already running and warn, wait for it to finish, or abort.
* **Chocolatey Preinstaller Checks Extension** will check if there are instances of choco.exe already running and warn, wait for it to finish, or abort.

    <summary>Chocolatey Preinstaller Checks Extension is a collection of helpers that check for possible unwanted conditions before installing and uninstalling Chocolatey packages.</summary>
    <releaseNotes>
* If two instances of choco.exe run within 5 seconds (or configured check time) of each other, they will most likely loop forever or until [commandExecutionTimeoutSeconds](https://chocolatey.org/docs/chocolatey-configuration).

###CHANGE LOG:
* 0.0.2 - Added conditional handling options for each of the three checks, completely configurable (See C:\ProgramData\chocolatey\extensions\chocolatey-preinstaller-checks\Chocolatey-Preinstaller-Checks.xml). Now compatible with [Chocolatey Toast Notifications Extension](https://chocolatey.org/packages/chocolatey-toast-notifications.extension). Get-chocoCounts replaced by Get-chocoInstanceCounts (Thanks by Michel Buczynski AKA MikeBoutch!) for Chocolatey Self Service Agent compatibility. Default 30 second pause changed to 5 seconds and cosmetically better display.
* 0.0.1 - initial release

###ROADMAP:
* Option to abort install/uninstall if PendingRebootStatus is true.
* Option to abort after a configurable amount of time waiting for other competing processes to finish.
