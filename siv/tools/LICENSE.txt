I contacted the author, Ray Hinchliffe, and he was given permission to distribute the binaries.

Hi Bill,

I think you are basically talking about how you would mirror siv.zip and am happy for you to use whatever works for you.

I am wondering how you would deal with a new SIV being released? Would you like to receive the e-mail I BCC to the other mirrors with siv.zip attached?

Regards, Ray
