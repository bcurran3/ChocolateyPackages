PACMAN THE GHOSTS REVENGE (c) PJ Crossley 2014

The ghosts have a new plan to thwart pacman INKY has stolen the power pills and carry's them around the maze with him. 
Since you need to get all pills to finish a level your only chance is to grab the power pills without touching HIM (IE: sneak up behind INKY and grab the end pill.) This is not as easy as it sounds as other ghosts can hinder your progress.

###Controls:
* Use arrow keys to move
* define your own keys or use joystick
