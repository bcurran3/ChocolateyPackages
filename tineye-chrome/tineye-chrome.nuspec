##This is the official TinEye Chrome extension. Find out where an image came from, how it's used, or find higher resolution versions.	

###ABOUT TINEYE

TinEye is the first image search engine on the web to use image identification technology, instead of using keywords, metadata or watermarks. When you submit an image to be searched, TinEye creates a unique and compact digital signature or 'fingerprint' for it, then compares this fingerprint to every other image in our index to retrieve matches. TinEye does not typically find similar images; it finds exact matches including those that have been cropped, edited or resized.

TinEye adds tens of millions of new images to its database every week.
