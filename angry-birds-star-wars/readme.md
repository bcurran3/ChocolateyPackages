**BCURRAN3'S PACKAGE NOTES:**

* DISCLAIMER: This package uses an AutoHotKey script to attempt automatic installation of the program. Luckily this one is small and simple, not much chance of the AHK script messing up.
* This program uses a customized version of VirtualBox to run an Android emulator and thus the game inside of it. Other games are available at https://games.lol/
* Ignore the version, it's not related to the game. It's the version of the installer. The game auto-updates the normal Google Play way within the emulator.
* Uninstall this through Control Panel, it's listed as MobiGame. I might make an AHK uninstall script in the future, but it looks like it would be "messy."
* I'm not responsible for your loss of productivity at work! 
* I've been using (playing) Clash Royale successfully for a few months.
