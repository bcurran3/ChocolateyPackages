Open Mahjong is the implementation of the original Mahjong board game.

Mahjong is a game that originated in China, commonly played by four players.
The four player table version should not be confused with the popular
western single player (tile matching) computer game (Mahjong solitaire)
which is a recent invention and completely different from the table game.
Mahjong is a game of skill, strategy and calculation and involves a 
certain degree of chance.
