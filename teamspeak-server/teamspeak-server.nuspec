TeamSpeak offers the ideal tool for online gaming, education and training, internal business communication, and staying in touch with friends and family. Our primary focus is delivering a solution that is easy to use, with high security standards, excellent voice quality, and low system and bandwidth usage. Featuring a client-server architecture, TeamSpeak is literally capable of handling up to thousands of simultaneous users.

###How it Works
Host your own TeamSpeak Server or rent one from an Authorized TeamSpeak Host Provider (ATHP). Share your TeamSpeak Server address with friends, teammates, or anyone you want to chat with. Using the free desktop client, they connect to your TeamSpeak Server using the address you provide them. Start talking. It's that easy!

####HIGH SCALABILITY
Client-Server architecture allows you to scale from small group conversations to large conferences with thousands of participants.

All TeamSpeak products are designed with your privacy in mind. We not track your voice or text chat data and there is no sign-up required.

####POWERFUL FILE TRANSFER

With our powerful hierarchical permission system, you are in complete control. Decide who can talk, who can join channels and much more.

####STUNNING 3D SOUND EFFECTS

####SECURITY
AES based encryption can optionally be enabled for the entire server or specific channels on the server. Additionally, to avoid potential threats arising from weak usernames and passwords, TeamSpeak uses public-private key authentication.
