    <summary>Automatically Detect and Install Your AMD Radeon Driver</summary>
    <description>
The AMD Driver Autodetect tool is designed to detect the model of graphics card and version of operating system installed in your computer. Our Autodetect tool can only be used on systems running the Microsoft® Windows operating system and/or AMD Radeon™ graphics. It does not work on Linux® systems, Apple Boot Camp systems or AMD FirePro™ graphics products.

If a new driver is available, the tool is designed to help you download it. After you download the driver, simply click “Install” to start your installation.​

NOTE: This tool is designed to provide the latest official AMD Radeon Software graphics driver for systems running Microsoft Windows. If your system is not running Microsoft Windows or you are looking for an earlier driver or the latest beta driver, you can manually search for a driver from the [AMD Graphics and Driver download page](https://support.amd.com/en-us/download).
