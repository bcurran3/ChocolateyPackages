PCI-Z is a freeware lightweight system utility designed to provide information about (unknown) PCI (PCI-E, PCI-X...) devices and helps you find appropriate device drivers.

PCI-Z is designed for detecting unknown hardware on your Windows based PC. It will help you determine vendor, device and certain details about device even if you don't have drivers installed. Software uses The PCI ID Repository, a public repository of all known ID's used in PCI devices: ID's of vendors, devices, subsystems and device classes. It is used in various programs (e.g. The PCI Utilities) to display full human-readable names instead of cryptic numeric codes. It is almost similar to lspci Linux command but with full Windows support.

You can find drivers for your operating system without a problem! Find drivers for your WiFi cards, audio cards, network cards or any other PCI peripheral.

Both 32 bit (x86) and 64 bit (x64) Windows versions are fully supported, where applicable. Both i386 and amd64 kernels of Windows PE are supported as well. PCI-Z also works on Bart PE/Reatogo, "live CD" of Windows XP. In addition, you can run PCI-Z on ReactOS in full functionality. ReactOS is a free open source operating system based on the best design principles found in the Windows NT architecture - providing completely and in all ways legal and free platform for running PCI-Z without any Windows licenses necessary. Software will NOT run on Windows 95, 98 or ME.

It does not require any library but default Windows ones. No Visual Studio C++ redistributed, no .NET platform, no Java. Windows components such as WMI (Windows Management Instrumentation) are also not required.

From January 2015 PCI-Z is digitally signed for your protection (version 1.3). New version 1.4 will also have digital signature.

There is no installation or configuration! Simply run the file and wait until you get the report. Afterwards, right click on the line to get options (copy all data or just a segment) or export the whole list.

The author of CPU-Z has granted me permission to use a name similar to his product. Thanks Franck!
