VideoLAN's webpage at https://www.videolan.org/legal.html has the redistribution rights defined in this section quoted from the page:

"May I redistribute a piece of VideoLAN software?
Yes, you may distribute an original or a modified version of a piece of VideoLAN software as long as you comply with its license terms.
Most pieces of software from VideoLAN are licensed under the GNU General Public License Version 2 (referred herein as GPL).
You will find a license file named COPYING in all our products.
Note: You do not need to ask VideoLAN the permission to distribute VideoLAN software!

How do I redistribute a piece of VideoLAN software?
You should refer to the GPL license to do so, and notably its 3rd paragraph.
One of the easiest way to conform to the GPL is to accompany the product you want to distribute with its sources.
For example, if you plan to distribute the latest binary version of VLC on a DVD-ROM, you should also include the VLC source code and the source code for the underlying included libraries on the same media."
